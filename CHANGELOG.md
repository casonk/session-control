# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Answer `/_portfolio/*` itself from a vendored portfolio site seam (`session_control/portfolio/`), so the theme and top bar work with no Caddy in front: the owner-only site store first, then a pinned fallback copy. Add `/.portfolio` (ignored) and `config/portfolio-site.example.toml`. See traction-control `docs/portfolio-sites.md`.

- Follow the portfolio system themes: pages take their colours from the shared tokens (`/_portfolio/theme.css`), so the theme chosen in the top bar restyles them.

- Load the portfolio top bar (`<script src="/_portfolio/chrome.js" defer></script>`, served by the shared Caddy) on every page, so the global navigation and theme rotator appear here too.
- Ignore hidden directories in Copilot's session state, so its operation-lock
  directory no longer fails the scan and the daily prune job.
- Add a **Machine load** page (`/ecu`, JSON at `/api/ecu`) showing the held lease
  (command, priority, mode, GPU size), GPU memory and processes, and each timer
  job's run/defer verdict from `ecu status --json`. It explains itself when the
  `ecu` command is missing (`SESSION_CONTROL_ECU_BIN` overrides the lookup).
- Claude Code sessions launched with `crew-chief code` are read from the
  crew-chief session registry, labelled `local · <model>`, and resumed through
  `crew-chief code` so they reopen on the same local backend.
